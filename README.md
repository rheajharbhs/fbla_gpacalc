# FBLA-GPA-Calculator Project

My attempt to create a pure html, css and javascript based website to calculate Weighted and Unweighted GPA for students at Rock Bridge High School - FBLA assignment


How To Use The Website: Enter the grade for your class in the "Enter Grade" Drop-Down Menu. Then, enter the class type in the "Enter your class type" drop-down. For example, if you are taking an AP Class, you will choose "AP". CLick the button "Enter Next Grade" and enter the grade and class type for your next class. When you are done entering for all your classes, click the "Calculate" button to get the Weighted and Unweighted GPA. If at any point you want to restart, whether you made a mistake or want to calculate GPA again, click "Restart Calculations". If you have any questions about weighted and unweighted GPA, or how to use the webiste, you can naviagte to the information page on the bar at the top of the website. Through this bar you can toggle between the calculator and the information page.
